# My Developer portfolio

- I am creating this page as a challenge to introduce ne skills and test my abilities to learn somethings I have never tried before. This project uses React for the frontend, Spring Boot as the server and postgres for the database. It gives me the opportunity to try and code my first project in Java. I will need to know JavaScript, Java, SQL, HTTP, and more to complete the project. I am planning to deploy the site on Amazon EC2 to get more experience with that platform as well. Wish me luck.
